ðŸ“Œ Leveraging NLP to Improve Ad Targeting, Content Strategy, and Campaign Performance

This repository demonstrates how Topic Modeling (using LDA & NMF) can extract key themes from customer data to optimize advertising channels.


ðŸš€ Key Features
âœ” Extracts hidden topics from customer reviews, social media, and search queries
âœ” Optimizes ad creatives by aligning messaging with audience interests
âœ” Improves audience targeting for Google/Facebook/YouTube ads
âœ” Tracks trends & sentiment to adjust campaigns in real-time


ðŸ“Š How It Works
1. Data Input
Supports CSV/JSON data (e.g., Facebook ad comments, Amazon reviews, Google Search queries).

Example columns: text, timestamp, user_id.

2. Topic Modeling (LDA/NMF)
Identifies key themes like:

["delivery", "fast", "shipping"] â†’ Highlight speed in ads

["price", "expensive", "discount"] â†’ Run promo campaigns

3. Actionable Outputs
Word Clouds (visualize top keywords)

Topic Trends Over Time (track rising/falling interests)

Sentiment Analysis (detect complaints early)

ðŸ’¡ Use Cases for Advertisers
